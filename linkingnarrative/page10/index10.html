		<p>A couple weeks after his funeral, I was cleaning the house with <a href="../page11/index11.html">Veronica</a> by my side, proudly displaying the new mittens her aunt had purchased for her in hopes that she might stop scratching. So far, theyâ€™d worked pretty well. For whatever reason, Veronica was in one of her rare good moods as we went through the house. I was boxing up small stuff that had belonged to Paul. It hurt too much to see it every day.</p>
