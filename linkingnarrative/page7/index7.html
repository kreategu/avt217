		<p>The <a href="../page8/index8.html">stress</a> of Veronica’s episodes strained the relationship between my husband and me. I could tell his depression had reemerged. Still, I cared more about my innocent daughter than my adult spouse. The doctors asked that we begin to taper off Veronica’s medication to see if things got any better. I couldn’t see any difference. Veronica was always scared and kept scratching herself when we weren’t around, usually when she was asleep.</p>
