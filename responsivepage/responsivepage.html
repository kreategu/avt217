        	    <p>Everyone has a skin type—understanding yours should be simple, right? Wrong! Skin type is one of beauty’s biggest enigmas. It’s that vague, wordy identifier that dermatologists and facialists say should dictate everything you do in your skincare routine, from your cleanser and your moisturizer to what types of fancy-schmancy masks work for you. And turns out, most people don’t even know what theirs is. That might be you! Glad you’re here.</p>
